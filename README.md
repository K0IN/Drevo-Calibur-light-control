## how to install 

first you need to install the official software from [The Drevo software Site](https://www.drevo.net/page/software) (or use the [hosted version](https://mega.nz/file/vExzASrb#q6EHiK_nmsb4mB7z8xF2xIXvaSTDoOTTM6NGElUVkek))  
then locate the file "DREVO72HWI.dll" in your installation directory (default is C:\Program Files (x86)\DREVO\DREVO72)
Copy the dll in the path of your executable

You can find a example executable in the [releases](https://github.com/K0IN/Drevo-Calibur-light-control/releases/tag/001) that will set all keys to white
